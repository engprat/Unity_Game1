**Unity_Game1**

Unity_Game1 is a first-person 3D maze game developed in Unity, where the player must navigate through a complex maze to find their way out. The game focuses on exploration and problem-solving, challenging the player to use spatial awareness and memory to escape the maze.

Features
  - First-Person Perspective: The game is played from a first-person viewpoint, offering an immersive experience as players navigate the maze.
  
  - 3D Maze: The game environment features a fully 3D maze with walls, paths, and dead ends, designed to challenge the playerâ€™s sense of direction.
  
  - Exploration-Based Gameplay: Players must explore the maze, remembering landmarks and paths, to eventually find the exit. The maze's design encourages problem-solving and critical thinking.
  
  - Simple Controls: Intuitive controls allow players to move around and look in any direction, making it easy to explore the maze at their own pace.

  Look Around: Use the mouse to look around in any direction.
  Exit Maze: The goal of the game is to find the exit of the maze as quickly as possible.
  
Purpose: Unity_Game1 is designed to experiment with first-person controls and navigation in a 3D environment. The project serves as a foundational test for creating immersive, exploration-based games.

Future Development: Planned future updates may include more complex mazes, additional features such as time trials, and visual enhancements to improve the overall experience.
